## Election-Audit Summary: 

#By using the *PyPoll_Challenge.py*, the election commission can reuse the code the obtain voter information as shown in the picture above.  The code can be modified to get information for county and candidate.  This data can then be transferred to text file for further auditing.  

#Two examples on how this script can be modified are:
- Find the county with the lowest county turnout.
